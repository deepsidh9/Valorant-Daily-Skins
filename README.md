# Valorant Daily Skins

This project gets your daily in-store skins in Valorant without starting the actual game. (WebApp &amp; Windows executable)

## Description

### Windows Executable Version

Python is used to authenticate users, fetch skins and create the graphical user interface via Tkinter. Pyinstaller is used to create the Windows executable file. [Check here for code](https://github.com/deepsidh9/Valorant-Daily-Skins/tree/windowsapp). 

You can also directly download the file which runs directly on your Windows device from [here](https://github.com/deepsidh9/Valorant-Daily-Skins/releases/tag/windowsapp-v1.0)

### Flask Web Application Version

Python is used to authenticate users, fetch skins and serve the HTML templates via Flask. Gunicorn is used to serve requests if the application is running through Docker.[Check here](https://github.com/deepsidh9/Valorant-Daily-Skins/tree/flaskwebapp)
